Wurst::AlDb
-----------
-----------

This directory keeps track of the evolving wurst alignment
database. There are two sides to this :

Wurst::AlDb.pm  ( and Wurst::AlDb::*)
 - Set of Class::DBI derived classes which interface to a database
 whose structure is given as SQL'sed schema in AlDb.pm.

Wurst::SeqStrCmp.pm
 - the set of routines used to generate alignments.
Importantly, SeqStrCmp.pm holds two different alignment
implementations and routines to vary parameters and alignment
protocols. The details of these get stored in the database so we know
which alignment was done with what approach.

Dependencies
------------

Currently, you'll need :
Class::DBI
mysql-whatever (and DBD::mysql)
Compress:Zlib
Wurst::Guts


Scripts
-------

Generally, everything that starts with test_ is a testing
script. These were used to develop the methods actually used.
There is no makefile as such here. In principal, the modules will get
installed along with Wurst.pm/libWurst.a etc, but that isn't linked in yet.

aldb_* are scripts that do something useful. They are still not
perfect.
 - create AlType entries.
 - modify AlType entries.
 - queue pending alignments
 - calculate alignments
 - revert calculated alignments back to queued alignments.
 - do a very large mpi job to calculate alignments. (unwieldly at the
 - moment)
   - you need Parallel::MPI::Simple(0.3b) for this
   (Parallel::MPI::SimD).
   That can be checked out here:
   cvs -d/bm/cvs Parallel-MPI-Simple
   .. it should build ok if you have a sane MPI installation.
   .. one day it might make it to CPAN.
